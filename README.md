# Superstore-Sales-Report

I analyzed the sales of a Superstore in the United States over a period of four years. I summarized my findings in four reports in Power BI. I used four  reports because I did not want to cram up a lof of information into one report. The report are broken down as follows;

* Sales by category and sub-category
* Analysis of least profitable sub-categories
* Sales by geograhical location
* Sales by product

  <h2>Sales by Category and Sub-category</h2>
