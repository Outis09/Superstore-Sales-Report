  <h1>Superstore Sales Report</h1>
</div>

I analyzed the sales of a Superstore in the United States over a period of four years. I summarized my findings in four reports in Power BI. I used four  reports because I did not want to cram up a lot of information into one report. The reports are broken down as follows;

* Sales by category and sub-category
* Analysis of least profitable sub-categories
* Sales by geographical location
* Sales by product
