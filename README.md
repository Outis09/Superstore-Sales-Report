# Superstore Sales Report

I analyzed the sales of a Superstore in the United States over a period of four years. I summarized my findings in four reports in Power BI. I used four  reports because I did not want to cram up a lof of information into one report. The report are broken down as follows;

* Sales by category and sub-category
* Analysis of least profitable sub-categories
* Sales by geograhical location
* Sales by product

KPIs:

Over the four year period;
* The superstore made a total of $2.3M in sales
* The superstore realized a profit of $286.4K
* There were 38k orders
* The superstore offered discounts amounting to $1.6K

Technology with total sales of $836K was the highest category in sales followed by Furniture with $742K and lastly, Office Supplies with $719K sales.

Despite making the most sales, Technology had the least orders with a total order of 7K while Office Supplies with the least sales had the most orders totalling 23K. Furniture had 8K orders.

Of the 286.4K profit the Superstore realized, Technology accounted for 50.79% with a profit of $145.5K.
Office Supplies accounted for 42.77% with a profit of $122.5K.
Furniture, the least profitable category with a profit of $18.5K accounted for 6.44% of total profit.

Over the 4 years, the sub-category that made the most sales was Phones from the Technology category. Phones made sales amounting to $330K.

The second sub-category with the most sales was Chairs from the Furniture category. Chairs made sales of $328K.

The third highest sub-category in terms of sales was Storage from the Office Supplies category. It made $224K in sales.

From the line chart, it is evident sales took a dip in 2014. However, profit and orders increased by 24% and 5.2% respectively.

Even though the above report is statis, the original report is interactive.

A video demonstrating how interactive the report is can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samuelayer07/status/1575169059104358400).
